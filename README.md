Student Exercise Answer Key

#2 NotificationStates – local; state pattern; Scanner input
Demonstration shown as completed

#3 FileFSM – local; state pattern; Scanner input
Student Exercise Answer Key

#4 TurnstileFSM – roboRIO; j-easy easy states (SLAB older version); 5 turnstiles; SmartDashboard input
Demonstration shown as completed

#5 FanFSMroboRIO – roboRIO; j-easy easy states (SLAB newer version); 2 fans; SmartDashboard input
Student Exercise Answer Key

#6 ElevatorFSM Example – roboRIO; 3 different coding styles - linear path and 2 FSM styles; Joystick input
See Elevator2019Robot.java for FSM version
Demonstration shown as completed

#7 FSMtemplate - roboRIO; similar to the FSM example in #6.  One complete worked nice FSM style using enums and table look up
of a Moore FSM - a good model

#8 RosettaCode - copied a FSM example (Java version) from RosettaCode web site
